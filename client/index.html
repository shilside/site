            <p>
              Greetings, my name is <span>Joshua Njoku</span>, and I am a
              dedicated <span>Full-Stack Web Developer</span> with a penchant
              for creative problem-solving. Currently based in
              <span>Montreal, Canada</span> my formative years were spent in
              Rivers State, Nigeria, where I developed a love for solving math
              problems that would eventually lead me to the World of
              Programming. During the pandemic, I took it upon myself to learn
              programming and enrolled in a
              <span>Full-Stack Engr. Bootcamp </span>at
              <span>McGill University</span>, which I successfully
              completed<span>&#x2705;</span>. Programming has since become more
              than a career choice for me; it is a passion that allows me to
              channel my creative energy into building innovative projects. I am
              also an aspiring musician who goes by the stage name
              <span>"Shilside"</span>. I have always been drawn to the art of
              creation, and programming has provided me with the perfect
              platform to express myself. I am continuously looking for new and
              exciting opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my
              skills, and I am confident that I have what it takes to make a
              significant impact in the Tech Industry.
